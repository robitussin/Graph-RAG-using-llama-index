 CHAPTER 1  
THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY  
 
SECTION 1:   BRIEF HISTORY  
A young man, barely 23 years old, had a vision of inculcating among the youth the qualities of competence 
and leadership, high moral and spiritual values and development of everyone  into a total person. These 
would be acquired through an educational process guided by the philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.  
This philosophy has as its guiding tenets, the internalizing all that is good in the Filipino people: warmth, 
hospitality, innovativeness, and a high emotional quotient that has made Filipinos renowned in service 
oriented industries.”  
This young man, Don Mariano Fortunato Jhocson, guided by this vision, founded Colegio Filipino, now 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY on August 01, 1900, in Quiapo, City of Manila. It was the first non – sectarian and 
co – educational institution then. There were only a handful of students at that time in the fledgling 
School, and they were in the elementary and secondary (High School) lev els. Don Mariano, to help the 
school grow, was teacher, director and janitor rolled into one.  
In a short span of 5 years, he offered courses in Business – bookkeeping and accounting, convinced that 
thus armed, his students would be financially secure and respectable after graduation. This led to the 
changing of the name to Colegio Mercantil, awardi ng the diploma of Perito Mercantil. A short time later, 
the Philippine Law School was opened with the collaboration of the Lacson brothers. Don Mariano saw 
the dire need for training the youth for leadership and responsibility. He firmly believed that the discipline 
of Law would turn out men and women who would eventually be advocates for Philippine self -
government.  
In 1916, the Board of Trustees changed the name from Colegio Mercantil to National Academy. The 
growth of the Academy was continuous, and added Liberal Arts which became the gateway to other 
disciplines that followed.  
After 21 years of educational service, on January 17, 1921, the Board of Trustees applied for and secured 
permission from the Department of Public Instruction to change the name of the National Academy to 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. On that same day, the Universi ty also installed Senator Camilo Osias, one of the 
most respected and outstanding Filipino educators as President of the University.  
Thereafter, the Colleges of Education and Commerce were opened in the same year. During the following 
years, the Colleges of Pharmacy and Dentistry were opened in 1922. The College of Engineering, offering 
initially Civil Engineering opened in 1925 and the  Normal School in 1930. Sanitary Engineering was initially 
offered in 1930.  
From July 1945, its facilities have since continuously expanded and the following disciplines were added 
– bachelor’s degrees in chemical , Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical Engineering and Architecture and Arts. 
Master in Sanitary Engineering was also organized.  Title:

SECTION 10:  JOB SECURITY  
Job security to many is an assurance (or lack of it) that an employee has about the continuity of gainful 
employment for his or her work life. Job security usually arises from the terms of the employment contract 
and is discussed in collective bargaining agreement or other labor legislations that prevents arbitrary 
termination, layoffs, and lockouts.  
In this regard, National University seeks to provide all regular employees with security of employment 
consistent with conditions over which it has control. Hence, it stabilizes employment insofar as practicable 
through careful planning and balancing of op erational requirements.  
When fluctuations in personnel requirements occur, National University tries to avoid layoffs by 
transferring personnel within the institution. Preference will be given to employees having greater 
seniority provided they have the necessary qualifications.  
 
SECTION 11: SERVICE RECOGNITION  
A University wide Service Awarding is held every year during its Foundation Day ceremonies.  All 
employees, Teaching and Non -teaching, who have rendered 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 years of 
fulltime service are recognized.  
Commendation awards for exemplary/excellent performance may also be given to deserving employees 
during this event.  The exemplary/excellent performance award shall be recommended by the Unit 
Director, endorsed by the VP or Campus Head,  and approved by the President.

4.1 Official Business Defined  
Official Business (OB) is work done outside National University to transact business on behalf of the 
school, such as but not limited to represent the National University in conferences, seminars, 
trainings, events, organization meetings, CHED meetings and representations.  This also includes all 
travels by the messenger, liaison and other p ersonnel tasked to coordinate with the other offices in 
relation to the needs of National University, such as but not limited to the Local Government Unit, SM 
offices, b anks, other campuses among others.

 SECTION 5:  ATTENDANCE AND REPORTING FOR WORK  
5.1 National University faculty are expected to be present for work, on time according to their schedule 
of class/work. Regular attendance and punctuality are important for smooth operation of your team 
and the University as a whole.  Absenteeism causes disrup tions and burdens colleagues.  
 
5.2 The attendance record is part of the performance evaluation rating. It will also be considered for other 
disciplinary action, including termination.  Hence, faculty is expected to report on their work on 
schedule and on time.    
 
5.3 Absence is the failure to report for work due to any reason. Any absence disrupts the smooth flow of 
work and unduly increases the burden on the rest of the College /School .  Frequently absenting oneself 
from work justifies corrective measures. Excessive absenteeism and/or tardiness will lead to 
disciplinary action, including  termination.  Absence from work for six ( 6) consecutive days without 
properly notifying the Dean /Program Chair/ Coordinator is considered  abandonment of work and is 
subject to dismissal.  
 
5.4 Absences due to illness, valid personal reasons, emergencies, force majeure may be excused as 
evaluated and approved by the Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator. The faculty must notify the 
Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator, by any means, on or before the first wor king hour of the day of the 
impending absence.  The faculty should file this under the sick leave to be approved by the 
Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator.  
 
5.5 If the immediate supervisor is not available, contact the Human Resources office prior to the start of 
the workday and leave a contact number to enable the supervisor to return call .  Failure to properly  
inform the supervisor will result to an unexcused absence which is subject to disciplinary measures.  
 
5.6 Absence without authorized leave or failure to file an official leave of absence is inexcusable and shall 
be charged against the faculty’s salary.  
 
SECTION 6:  TARDINESS AND UNDERTIME  
6.1 Each faculty is important to the overall success of National University operations. When not at one’s 
post, someone else must do the job. Thus, each one is expected to report for work on time at the 
scheduled start of the workday. Reporting for work on tim e means that one is ready to start work, not 
just arriving at the scheduled starting time.  
 
6.2 Habitual tardiness shall adversely affect one’s  performance evaluation and consequently affect 
chances of promotion, salary increases and continued employment with National University. 
Tardiness  means reporting for work late or beyond the starting time.  
 
6.3 Undertime  means abandonment of work before the dismissal time. Like tardiness, it is a violation of 
the rules on work hours. The faculty shall fill up an Undertime Authorization Form and shall be duly Title:

 CHAPTER  10 
CODE OF DISCIPLINE  
No written policy can prescribe an appropriate action for every business situation. This Code of Discipline 
defines only the minimum standards which must be observed and guide every employee in his/her daily 
work and relationships. This chapter states the policy on discipline, faculty conduct and behavior, 
grievance procedure and the schedule of offenses and the corresponding sanctions.  
 
SECTION 1:  POLICY STATEMENT  
It is the sincere desire of National University to help its faculty in every way possible so that both will 
succeed in their respective endeavors, but willful or inexcusable breach of the Code will be dealt with 
firmly under a uniform policy such that the provisions of this Code shall apply to all faculty regardless of 
status, rank,  or position.  
National University views disciplinary action more of a correction or preventive measure than a punitive 
one.  National University, in adopting and promulgating these rules and regulations, intend to abort the 
misconduct and offenses caused by a minority, if not isolated few, of the faculty. National University does 
not in any way want that the great majority of the employees who are performing efficiently and loyally 
and who make National University a respected organization to feel that the adoption of the se policies is 
an adverse reflection on them.  
 
SECTION 2:  ETHICAL CONDUCT  
2.1 To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, faculty are expected to abide by ethical standards 
and the Code of Ethics of Teachers.  
 
2.2 Faculty should not solicit anything of value from any person or organization with whom the National 
University has a current or potential business relationship.  
 
2.3 Faculty should not accept any item of value from any party in exchange for or in connection with a 
business transaction between National University and that other party.  
 
2.4 Faculty may accept items of incidental value from customers, suppliers, or others if the gift is not 
given in response to solicitation of favor and long as it implies no exchange for business any purpose. 
Items may include gifts, gratuities, food, drink,  and entertainment.  
 
2.5 If faced with and unsure how to handle a situation that may potentially violate this code of ethical 
conduct, notify the Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator. Violations of this code may lead to 
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

reasonable rules of conduct which must be followed in any organi zation to help a group of people 
work together effectively.  The University expects each faculty to present himself or herself in a 
professional appearance and manner.  If a faculty is not considerate of others and does not observe 
reasonable work rules, d isciplinary action will be taken.  
 
3.3 Depending on the severity or frequency of the disciplinary problems, a verbal or written reprimand, 
suspension without pay, disciplinary probation, or dismissal may be necessary.  It is within National 
University’s sole discretion to select the appropriate  disciplinary action to be taken.  
 
3.4 Any faculty who commits any infraction of National University rules of conduct, policies and other 
regulations after due process shall be subject to the commensurate disciplinary action or sanction 
which may be imposed by the Human Resources Officer in accordance with the following:  
Schedule of Offenses and Sanctions  
3.1.1 Reprimand  
3.1.2 Written Warning  
3.1.3 Suspension of 5 working days or 15 working days  
3.1.4 Dismissal  
Management reserves the right to determine the appropriate punitive sanction to any infraction, 
based on merits of the case.  
 
SECTION 4:  PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE  
4.1 The following is not a complete list of offenses for which a faculty may be subject to discipline, but 
it is illustrative of those offenses that may result in immediate discipline, up to and including

 ANNEX D: REVISED STANDARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (SPES) FOR FACULTY  
I. OBJECTIVES  
This policy has the following objectives:  
A. Evaluate faculty performance based on the faculty’s teaching, research, and community 
engagement responsibilities.  
B. Motivate the faculty to perform to their full potential.  
C. Provide the basis for annual merit, renewal of term appointment, appointment to 
probationary or permanent status, promotion in rank, and faculty development.  
 
II. SCOPE  
The SPES for Faculty comprises Teaching Effectiveness, Research and Innovation, Community 
Engagement, and Professional Development.  It applies to all faculty members with term and 
regular appointments, part -time (PT) and full -time (FT).  For SPES purposes , adjunct faculty will 
be evaluated similarly to part -time faculty. The use of the term “college” in this document refers 
to the colleges in NU Main and the schools in NU campuses.  
 
III. GENERAL GUIDELINES  
A. Each component of the SPES has an allocated maximum point.  Any point in excess from 
each component is not transferable to other components.  Similarly, each sub -component 
has a maximum point allocation, and any point in excess is not transferable to other  sub-
components.  
B. The minimum SPES rating of a faculty must be equal to or better than the institutional Key 
Performance Indicator (KPI) for the Faculty SPES rating for the academic year.  SPES rating 
falling below the KPI may be a ground for non -renewal of contract in the case of part -time, 
contractual full -time, and probationary full -time faculty or further performance review for 
regular faculty.   
C. For faculty with term appointments, the Teaching Effectiveness rating, particularly the 
Online Teachers Evaluation (OTE), maybe a basis for the non -renewal of the contract in the 
succeeding term.  
D. Details of the activities, accomplishments, engagements, etc., must be listed per component.  
Supporting documents must be available for verification upon request.  
E. Only activities or undertakings accomplished within the evaluation period must be reflected 
in the SPES unless indicated.  Any activity or accomplishment should only be reflected or 
credited in one component.  
F. Submission of the College SPES Summary to the Human Resource Office (HRO) is as follows:  
• 15 days after the end of the term for PT faculty  
• 30 days after the end of the Academic Year (AY) for FT faculty

 IV. FREQUENCY  
A. The SPES for full -time faculty, whether probationary, contractual, or regular, will be required 
once at the end of every academic year.   
B. The SPES for part -time faculty will be required at the end of every term.  
 
V. RATING REFERENCE  
A. The rating reference for the Faculty SPES is consistent with the instruments used by the 
University in evaluating the performance of its personnel.  
B. Unless otherwise reflected in the Institutional Quality Objectives, a faculty must receive a 
descriptive rating of at least “Meets Expectation.”    
C. The rating reference is as shown below:  
 
Range  Description  From  To 
6.51  7.00  Truly Exceptional  
6.00  6.50  Excellent  
5.00  5.99  Exceeds Expectations  
4.00  4.99  Meets Expectation  
3.00  3.99  Fairly Satisfactory  
2.00  2.99  Unsatisfactory  
1.00  1.99  Very Unsatisfactory  
 
VI. SPES COMPONENTS  
The SPES is composed of four (4) areas upon which the performance of the faculty will be 
evaluated:  
• Teaching Effectiveness  
• Research and Innovation  
• Community Engagement  
• Professional Development  
All full -time faculty will be evaluated on the four (4) components.  The part -time faculty 
considering the nature of their engagement with the University, will only be assessed on 
Teaching Effectiveness.  
A. Weight Distribution  
The weight distribution of each SPES component is as shown below per campus type.
